# Whales

This project is designed to work with Underwater Africa's existing datasets. It takes sea surface temperature, sea surface color, bathymetry, and sea surface height? (surface currents?) to create a complete dataset at 0.1 x 0.1 degree and daily resolution. From there, I'm planning to add whale presence data, along with (maybe) pseudoabsences generated along search grid.

Random forest?
